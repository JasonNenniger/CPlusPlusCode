This code inputs the balance owing on a credit card from the console and outputs the minimum monthly payment for every 
month until the balance is paid off.  For a monthly balance that is less than $10, the payment is the remaining balance.  
For a balance that is greater than $10, the larger of the following two options is the monthly payment:

- 1% of the balance + the monthly interest (2%) of the balance
- $10

Negative balances have a minimum payment of $0.  Example output is provided at the end of the code in the comments.
