This code takes the distance a taxi drove, the direction the taxi drove, and the number of stops that the taxi made and 
calculates a cumulative distance and cost, along with the final total distance and cost.  The taxi data is taken from the 
file "taxiDir_Rev.txt" and the output data is stored in a file called "TaxiCost.txt".  Sample output is provided at the 
end of the code in the comments.
