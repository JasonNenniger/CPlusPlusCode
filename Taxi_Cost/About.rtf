\f0\fs24 \cf0 This code takes the distance a taxi drove, the direction the taxi drove, and the number of stops that the taxi made and calculates a cumulative distance and cost, along with the final total distance and cost.  The taxi data is taken from the file \'93taxiDir_Rev.txt\'94 and the output data is stored in a file called \'93TaxiCost.txt\'94.  Sample output is provided at the end of the code in the comments.}
